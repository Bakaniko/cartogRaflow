Making thematic flowmap in R - Dealing with spaghetti-effect

This package is designed to create the so-called flowmaps - thematic origin-destination (OD) maps by filtering flow values.
It is based on different functions that are mainly used to prepare the flow dataset before the cartographic step. The spatial objects processing are those of `{sp}` and the mapping elements are often those of `{Cartography}` except for particular cases - for example, the design of arrows.
